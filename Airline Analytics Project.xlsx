# Airline Passenger Satisfaction Dashboard
## Project Objective
An airline wants to analyze passenger satisfaction ratings across a wide range of categories (including online booking, baggage handling, seat comfort, inflight wi-fi and everything in between).
This analysis will give the airline a better idea of what features need to be improved upon, and what types of customers are the least satisfied.
