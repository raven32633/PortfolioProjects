**COVID Data Exploration**

*In this data analysis project, I used real COVID data to explore/analyze global infection rates, death rates and vaccination rates. The dataset I used spans from 1/5/2020 through 8/4/24 and     it was retrieved from: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths 
* Some of the skills I used in my analysis include: Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, and Converting Data Types.
* After analyzing the data, I created a dashboard in Tableau to visualize my results:

#Airline Passenger Satisfaction Dashboard
##Project Objective
An airline wants to analyze passenger satisfaction ratings across a wide range of categories (including online booking, baggage handling, seat comfort, inflight wi-fi and everything in between).
This analysis will give the airline a better idea of what features need to be improved upon, and what types of customers are the least satisfied.
