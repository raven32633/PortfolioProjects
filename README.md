**COVID Data Exploration**

In this data analysis project, I used real COVID data to explore/analyze global infection rates, death rates and vaccination rates. The dataset I used spans from 1/5/2020 through 8/4/24 and it was retrieved from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths 

Some of the skills I used in my analysis include: Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, and Converting Data Types. After analyzing the data, I created a dashboard in Tableau to visualize my results:
