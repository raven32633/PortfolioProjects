This ReadMe will provide a summary of the various data analytics Projects I've done. Each project will have it's own respective folder within this portfolio projects folder. 

**1. COVID Data Exploration**

*In this data analysis project, I used real COVID data to explore/analyze global infection rates, death rates and vaccination rates. The dataset I used spans from 1/5/2020 through 8/4/24 and     it was retrieved from: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths 
* Some of the skills I used in my analysis include: Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, and Converting Data Types.
* After analyzing the data, I created a dashboard in Tableau to visualize my results:

**2. Airline Passenger Satisfaction Dashboard**

*In this project, I created an excel dashboard to analyze a mock set of data on 100,000 airline passengers satisfaction survey ratings. I analyzed the data by travel type, class, customer type, age group and gender to figure out which customers were the most/least satisfied. The full excel file can be found in the "Airline Passenger Satisfaction Dashboard" folder.
